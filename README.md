## Objective

The primary aim of this project is to analyze and understand the security landscape of cloud computing, emphasizing the increasing risks as cloud usage grows. This project serves as an academic exploration to identify potential security obstacles in cloud adoption.

## Cloud Computing Basics

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing offers on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. It allows for flexible, scalable, secure, and cost-efficient resource utilization over the internet.

### Types of Cloud Computing

- **Public Cloud**
- **Private Cloud**
- **Hybrid Cloud**

### Services Offered

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**

## Cloud Security Essentials

Cloud security involves policies, procedures, and technological tools to ensure data security, regulatory compliance, and control over privacy and authentication.

### Key Areas to Secure

- Physical networks
- Data storage and servers
- Virtualization frameworks
- Operating systems and middleware
- Runtime environments
- Data and applications
- End-user hardware

## Cloud Attack Surface

This section details common attack vectors in cloud environments, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial of service attacks.

### Types of Attacks

- **Exploiting Weak Credentials**
  - Brute Force Attacks
  - Credential Stuffing
- **Data Breaches**
  - API Key Exposure
  - SQL Injection
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**
  - Distributed DoS (DDoS)
- **Elevation of Privilege**
  - Hypervisor Vulnerabilities
  - Container and VM Escapes
- **Account Takeover**
  - Phishing and Session Hijacking

## Attack Tree

The project includes an attack tree diagram that illustrates various attack vectors and their relationships. It highlights major threats and vulnerabilities to the STRIDE properties of cloud security.
