# INSE6150-Project - Cloud Security Evaluation

## Cloud Security Evaluation

This repository contains our work for the INSE6150 course, focused on evaluating various security aspects of cloud computing. We explore the risks, threats,
and vulnerabilities that could impact the adoption of cloud technologies. This project was conducted as part of the coursework for INSE6150, Winter 2024.

## About Cloud Computing

Cloud computing provides scalable and flexible resources over the internet, including:
- Personal and corporate data storage
- Application hosting
- Database management

These services are available through various models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, 
and support multiple architectures including public, private, and hybrid clouds.

## Security Challenges Overview

The expansion of cloud computing introduces significant security challenges, including:
- Data breaches and data leaks
- Unauthorized access and data exposure
- Service disruptions and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

These challenges often stem from vulnerabilities in configuration, software flaws, and human errors.

## Evaluation Methodology

Our evaluation of cloud security encompasses several key steps:
1. Reviewing literature and case studies to outline prevalent vulnerabilities.
2. Analyzing reported security incidents and breaches.
3. Suggesting strategic measures to mitigate identified risks.


### Prerequisites

A basic understanding of cloud computing architectures and security principles is recommended to fully engage with the content and recommendations provided.
